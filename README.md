# Game Project Assignment   
  
## Game Concept  
You are tasked with developing a game called "Blockade," a high fantasy city defense and strategic building game. The game should feature a unique block-based terrain mechanic and be divided into distinct phases requiring strategic thinking, quick decision-making, and city planning skills.   
  
## City Defense   
The core of the game is the city that the players are required to defend against monstrous enemies. The city should have several entrance points vulnerable to enemy attacks. Players need to strategically place defensive towers and reshape the block-based terrain to obstruct enemy progress and protect the city gates.   
  
## Terrain Mechanics  
The terrain of the game should be block-based, allowing players to construct and destroy elements for strategic advantage. Players should be given a limited time in each phase to upgrade their city's defenses and reshape the terrain.   
  
## Enemy Mechanics  
The enemies in the game should be diverse monsters taken from high fantasy lore, each with unique abilities to keep the gameplay dynamic and challenging. Some enemies should be able to jump, fly, swim, or burrow, while others should be capable of breaking down city gates.   
  
## Phases  
The gameplay should be divided into phases, alternating between monstrous enemy waves and supply waves. Each phase should begin with a building time during which players can upgrade their defenses, enhance their towers, and manipulate the terrain.   
  
## Phase Mechanics and Player Actions  
During the phases, players should have the opportunity to fortify their city and prepare for the upcoming wave. Players should be able to place defensive towers, upgrade defenses, and manipulate the terrain. They should also be able to repair damage inflicted on city gates or towers by previous enemy waves.   
  
## Supply Management  
In addition to defending the city, players should also need to ensure supplies reach the city safely and timely. Supplies should be essential for upgrading and maintaining defensive towers, city gates, and other infrastructure. Players should be able to manipulate the terrain to create efficient supply routes.   
  
## Game Development  
To develop this game, you need to conceptualize, design, and execute each of these mechanics using suitable game development tools, such as the Godot engine. The game should offer an immersive experience, combining city defense, terrain manipulation, and supply management into an engaging package.   
  
In conclusion, your assignment is to create a captivating game that blends strategy, city defense, and fantasy elements. The game should demand players to plan meticulously, upgrade regularly, and strategically modify the terrain to ensure the city's safety and the timely arrival of supplies.
